                      privacy features. P.S. I came up with the ingenious name

                NUS allows undergraduates to be Teaching Assistants for modules
                they excelled in. I decided to take the opportunity and applied
                to be a Teaching Assistant for CS2103T, an introductory module
                to Software Engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
                My main responsibilities are conducting tutorials every week,
                and helping students with the team project they will have to
                submit at the end of the module.

              <h1>Joined Trabble</h1>
              <p>
                Due to the recall, I had to complete my NOC program at a local
                company in Singapore. I joined Trabble, another startup hoping
                to replace the physical concierge service in hotels.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built a meeting/facility booking web application with 2 other
                interns who were recalled back from overseas exchange programs
                too. The entire internship was remote. Despite so, I still
                gained valuable skills learning software development on Windows
                using the .NET frameworks.

              <h1>Joined NUS Overseas College (NOC) Program</h1>
              <p>
                I applied to the NOC program due to my overwhelmingly positive
                experience working at a startup and managed to get into the New
                York program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students on the program will spend 1 year in New York interning
                at a startup, picking up entrepreneurship skills along the way.
                I interned at Coord, a small startup that hopes to solve curb
                chaos in major cities.
              </p>
              <p>
                My time in New York was very eye opening. I met many people
                across various cultures and backgrounds. My time in Coord was
                also an amazing learning opportunity. I picked up so many skills
                from colleagues who are top-tier software engineers. However, I
                got recalled back to Singapore in March 2020 due to COVID-19.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh and I met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the
                Singapore Embassy in New York!

              <h1>Joined DateIdeas</h1>
              <p>
                In December 2018, I was looking for something to do during the
                winter break. I chanced upon an email looking for Software
                Engineer Interns to help build a website for a young startup.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to give it a shot. Despite having minimal guidance and
                spending most of my time fumbling through the codebase, I really
                loved the software development process in a startup. The
                uncertainty of things kept me on my toes and I liked how my work
                directly impacts the user.

              <p>
                I completed 2 years of mandatory military training in December
                2016. I was posted to the Fast Craft Training Unit at Tuas Naval
                Base.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire 2 years was a bittersweet experience. There were
                several aspects to National Service I did not enjoy. However, it
                did help me built up a habit to exercise regularly.

                I joined the Integrated Program at Hwa Chong Institution, which
                accelerates learning by combining 4 years of high school with 2
                years of junior college.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 6 years I spent at Hwa Chong was very fruitful. I enrolled
                into the Bicultural Studies Program, went on 6 weeks exchange as
                part of the Beijing Satellite Program, and even participated in
                the World Choir Games at Riga, Latvia. Eventually, I did pretty
                well for A levels and managed to get into the Computer Science
                program at the National University of Singapore.

                I spent the first 2 years of my primary school education at
                Xingnan Primary School before transferring over to Rulang
                Primary School, which is nearer to my house. I passed the

                My family moved to Singapore because my Dad was studying his PhD
                at the Nanyang Technological University. I spent a year in
                Kindergarten 2 before starting primary school education.

              <p>
                Because my english was pretty terrible back then, I remember
                making a very stupid mistake with an assignment back in
                kindergarten. I did not understand a single word on the
                worksheet, and ended copying another student's name onto my
                worksheet. My teacher was very amused that I wrote a girl's name
                on my worksheet.

                My hometown is Putian, China. We speak the Heng Hwa dialect, a
                less common cousin to Hokkien. Fun fact: I still speak my
                dialect fluently!
              </p>
              <p>
                Putian is famous for its white braised noodles, in stark
                contrast to the dark Hokkien version. Before the restaurant
                Putien was popularised in Singapore, it was really difficult to
                find good white braised noodles in Singapore!
